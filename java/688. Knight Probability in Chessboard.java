/**
 *Problem: 688. Knight Probability in Chessboard
 *On an n x n chessboard, a knight starts at the cell (row, column) and attempts to make exactly k moves. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, so the top-left cell is (0, 0), and the bottom-right cell is (n - 1, n - 1).
 *A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.
 *Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
 *The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard.
 *Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving
