'''
Problem: 916. Word Subsets
You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.

For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

class Solution:
    def wordSubsets(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        maxCharFreq = [0] * 26
        tempCharFreq = [0] * 26

        for word in words2:
            for ch in word:
                tempCharFreq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1
            for i in range(26):
                maxCharFreq[i] = max(maxCharFreq[i], tempCharFreq[i])
            tempCharFreq = [0] * 26

        universalWords = []

        for word in words1:
            for ch in word:
                tempCharFreq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1
            isUniversal = True
            for i in range(26):
                if maxCharFreq[i] > tempCharFreq[i]:
                    isUniversal = False
                    break
            if isUniversal:
                universalWords.append(word)
            tempCharFreq = [0] * 26

        return universalWords
